It provides\r\na standard implementation of state-of-the-art algorithms\r\nfor confocal smFRET analysis.\r\nFRETBursts is opensource and contributions are welcome.\r\nThe authors are committed to promptly fix bugs whenever discovered.\r\n\r\nIssues can be reported and discussed on the\r\n[issue tracker](https://github.com/tritemio/FRETBursts/issues?state=open).\r\nFixes or enhancements can be sent with a [github pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request).\r\nSmall corrections can be made directly online\r\nby clicking on the GitHub edit button of a specific file.\r\n\r\nFRETBursts allows to analyze both [single-spot](http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.283.5408.1676)\r\nand [multi-spot smFRET](http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2003704) data.\r\nAlternating laser excitation ([ALEX](http://dx.doi.org/10.1529/biophysj.104.054114))\r\nscheme is supported.\r\n\r\nMain analysis features includes:\r\n\r\n- background estimation as a function of time (for example in 30s windows)\r\n- sliding-window burst search with adaptive (background-dependent) rate-threshold. No timetrace binning required.\r\n- burst corrections: background, D-spectral leakage (bleed-through), A-direct excitation,\r\ngamma-factor\r\n- per-burst statistics (# photons, burst duration, E, S, peak rate in burst, etc...)\r\n- post-burst-search [selection functions](http://fretbursts.readthedocs.org/burst_selection.html) \r\n  (for ex.: [burst size](http://fretbursts.readthedocs.org/burst_selection.html#fretbursts.select_bursts.size), \r\n  [burst width](http://fretbursts.readthedocs.org/burst_selection.html#fretbursts.select_bursts.width), \r\n  [E, S](http://fretbursts.readthedocs.org/burst_selection.html#fretbursts.select_bursts.ES), ...). \r\n  Defining a new burst selection\r\ncriterium requires only a couple of lines of code.\r\n- [fit routines](http://fretbursts.readthedocs.org/fit.html) for FRET efficiency \r\n  ([1 and 2-gaussians histogram fit](http://fretbursts.readthedocs.org/data_class.html#fretbursts.burstlib.Data.fit_E_generic),\r\n  [MLE Poisson models](http://fretbursts.readthedocs.org/data_class.html#fretbursts.burstlib.Data.fit_E_ML_poiss), \r\n  [weighted least squares models](http://fretbursts.readthedocs.org/data_class.html#fretbursts.burstlib.Data.fit_E_m),\r\n  [weighted expectation maximization](http://fretbursts.readthedocs.org/data_class.html#fretbursts.burstlib.Data.fit_E_two_gauss_EM), \r\n  etc...)\r\n\r\nMoreover FRETBursts includes \r\n[a large set](https://github.com/tritemio/FRETBursts/blob/master/fretbursts/burst_plot.py) of modular \r\n[plot functions](http://fretbursts.readthedocs.org/files_description.html#module-fretbursts.burst_plot) for\r\nbackground, time-traces, rate-traces, E, S, ALEX histograms, weighted kernel\r\ndensity estimation ([KDE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_density_estimation))\r\nand more. Thanks to the excellent [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) library,\r\nFRETBursts can produce publication-quality plots out of the box.\r\n\r\nMotivations\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nThis software aims to be a reference implementation for both established\r\nand novel algorithms related to bursts analysis of smFRET data.\r\n\r\nDespite the broad diffusion of smFRET experiments on freely diffusing\r\nmolecules, before FRETBursts, no complete smFRET burst analysis software was\r\nfreely available on internet. Each group have re-implemented the analysis\r\nin-house with little or no code sharing. This is clearly sub-optimal\r\neither because specific advances in the burst analysis are not readily\r\navailable to a wide public of smFRET users and because subtle differences in\r\nimplementation make the comparison of experiments performed by different\r\ngroups problematic.\r\n\r\nWe envision FRETBursts both as a state-of-the-art burst analysis package\r\nfor smFRET experimenters, and as a benchmark for advanced users willing\r\nto explore new algorithms or to compare alternative implementations.\r\n\r\nSoftware Environment\r\n--------------------\r\nFRETBursts is written in the [python programming language](http://www.python.org/)\r\nusing the standard scientific-python stack of libraries (Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib, IPython).\r\nNot only FRETBursts but also the entire software stack on which it is built upon\r\nare open-source and freely available to any scientist.\r\n\r\nFRETBursts uses consolidated software engineering techniques (version control,\r\nunit testing, regression testing) and a workflow based on\r\n[IPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)\r\nto ensure robustness and reproducibility of the results. For example,\r\nwhen loading FRETBursts in an ipython notebook, the current commit ID is always\r\ndisplayed and saved.\r\n\r\nWe provide a [list of tutorials](#how-to-use) (IPython notebooks) that can be\r\nviewed online, edited and re-executed. The\r\n[reference documentation](http://fretbursts.readthedocs.org/)\r\nis generated by Sphinx extracting the docstring from the source.\r\n\r\n###External resources\r\n\r\nFor a comprehensive tutorial on using python for scientific computing:\r\n\r\n* [Python Scientific Lecture Notes](http://scipy-lectures.github.io/)\r\n\r\nIPython Notebook is an interactive web-based environment that allows mixing\r\nrich text, math and graphics with (live) code.
