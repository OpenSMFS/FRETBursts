It provides\r\na well-tested implementation of state-of-the-art algorithms\r\nfor confocal smFRET analysis.\r\nFRETBursts is opensource and contributions are welcome.\r\nThe authors are committed to promptly fix bugs whenever discovered.\r\n\r\nFRETBursts has full supports for [Photon-HDF5](http://photon-hdf5.org/) files: \r\nan open file format for single-molecule fluorescence experiments \r\n(see the [Biophys. J. paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/026484)).\r\n\r\nFRETBursts issues can be reported and discussed on the\r\n[issue tracker](https://github.com/tritemio/FRETBursts/issues?state=open).\r\nFixes or enhancements can be sent with a [github pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request).\r\nSmall corrections can be made directly online\r\n(by clicking on the GitHub edit button of a specific file).\r\n\r\nFRETBursts allows to analyze both [single-spot](http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.283.5408.1676)\r\nand [multi-spot smFRET](http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2003704) data.\r\nAlternating laser excitation ([ALEX](http://dx.doi.org/10.1529/biophysj.104.054114))\r\nscheme is supported.\r\n\r\nMain analysis features includes:\r\n\r\n- background estimation as a function of time (for example in 30s windows)\r\n- sliding-window burst search with adaptive (background-dependent) rate-threshold. No timetrace binning required.\r\n- burst corrections: background, D-spectral leakage (bleed-through), A-direct excitation,\r\ngamma-factor\r\n- per-burst statistics (# photons, burst duration, E, S, peak rate in burst, etc...)\r\n- post-burst-search [selection functions](http://fretbursts.readthedocs.org/en/latest/burst_selection.html)\r\n  (for ex.: [burst size](http://fretbursts.readthedocs.org/en/latest/burst_selection.html#fretbursts.select_bursts.size),\r\n  [burst width](http://fretbursts.readthedocs.org/en/latest/burst_selection.html#fretbursts.select_bursts.width),\r\n  [E, S](http://fretbursts.readthedocs.org/en/latest/burst_selection.html#fretbursts.select_bursts.ES), ...).\r\n  Defining a new burst selection\r\ncriterium requires only a couple of lines of code.\r\n- [fit routines](http://fretbursts.readthedocs.org/en/latest/fit.html) for FRET efficiency\r\n  ([multi-model histogram fit](http://fretbursts.readthedocs.org/en/latest/fit.html#fitting-e-or-s-histograms),\r\n  [MLE Poisson models](http://fretbursts.readthedocs.org/en/latest/data_class.html#fretbursts.burstlib.Data.fit_E_ML_poiss),\r\n  [weighted least squares models](http://fretbursts.readthedocs.org/en/latest/data_class.html#fretbursts.burstlib.Data.fit_E_m),\r\n  [weighted expectation maximization](http://fretbursts.readthedocs.org/en/latest/data_class.html#fretbursts.burstlib.Data.fit_E_two_gauss_EM),\r\n  etc...)\r\n\r\nMoreover FRETBursts includes\r\n[a large set](https://github.com/tritemio/FRETBursts/blob/master/fretbursts/burst_plot.py) of modular\r\n[plot functions](http://fretbursts.readthedocs.org/en/latest/files_description.html#module-fretbursts.burst_plot) for\r\nbackground, time-traces, rate-traces, E, S, ALEX histograms, weighted kernel\r\ndensity estimation ([KDE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_density_estimation))\r\nand more. Thanks to the excellent [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) library,\r\nFRETBursts can produce publication-quality plots out of the box.\r\n\r\nMotivations\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nThis software aims to be a reference implementation for both established\r\nand novel algorithms related to bursts analysis of smFRET data.\r\n\r\nDespite the broad diffusion of smFRET experiments on freely diffusing\r\nmolecules, before FRETBursts, no complete smFRET burst analysis software was\r\nfreely available on internet. Each group have re-implemented the analysis\r\nin-house with little or no code sharing. This is clearly sub-optimal\r\neither because specific advances in the burst analysis are not readily\r\navailable to a wide public of smFRET users and because subtle differences in\r\nimplementation make the comparison of experiments performed by different\r\ngroups problematic.\r\n\r\nWe envision FRETBursts both as a state-of-the-art burst analysis package\r\nfor smFRET experimenters, and as a toolkit for advanced users willing\r\nto develop new algorithms or to compare alternative implementations.\r\n\r\nSoftware Environment\r\n--------------------\r\nFRETBursts is written in the [python programming language](http://www.python.org/)\r\nusing the standard scientific-python stack of libraries (Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib, IPython).\r\nNot only FRETBursts but also the entire software stack on which it is built upon\r\nare open-source and freely available to any scientist.\r\n\r\nFRETBursts uses consolidated software engineering techniques (version control,\r\nunit testing, regression testing) and a workflow based on\r\n[Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)\r\nto ensure robustness and reproducibility of the results. For example,\r\nwhen loading FRETBursts, the current version (down to the commit ID) is always\r\ndisplayed (and saved together with the notebook).\r\n\r\nWe provide a [list of tutorials](#getting-started) (notebooks) that\r\ncan be viewed online, edited and re-executed. The\r\n[reference documentation](http://fretbursts.readthedocs.org/)\r\nis generated by Sphinx extracting the docstrings from the source code.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nBriefly, the installation requires installing a scientific python distribution\r\n(such as [Continuum Anaconda](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/))\r\nand then installing the `fretbursts` python package from the anaconda.org\r\nchannel called `tritemio`.\r\n\r\nFor installation instructions see:\r\n\r\n* [FRETBursts documentation: Getting started](http://fretbursts.readthedocs.org/en/latest/getting_started.html)\r\n\r\n## Getting started\r\n\r\nThe official FRETBursts documentation is built and hosted by ReadTheDocs:\r\n\r\n* [FRETBursts Documentation](http://fretbursts.readthedocs.org/)\r\n\r\nWe provide a list of Jupyter notebooks showing typical workflows\r\nfor smFRET analysis and illustrating FRETBursts functionalities.\r\nThese notebooks can be either viewed online or downloaded and executed locally\r\nusing publically available datasets (see below).
