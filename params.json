In the spirit of\r\nreproducible research, this software allows the authors and others to\r\nreproduce previous research and to perform new one. FRETBursts is open to\r\npublic scrutiny and the authors are committed to promptly fix bugs\r\nwhenever they are discovered.\r\n\r\nFRETBursts allows to analyze both [single-spot](http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.283.5408.1676)\r\nand [multi-spot smFRET](http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2003704) data.\r\nAlternating laser excitation ([ALEX](http://dx.doi.org/10.1529/biophysj.104.054114))\r\nscheme is supported as well.\r\n\r\nMain analysis features includes:\r\n\r\n- time-dependent background estimation (for example in 30s windows)\r\n- sliding-window burst search with background-dependent threshold\r\n- burst corrections: background, leakage (bleed-through), direct excitation,\r\ngamma-factor\r\n- per-bursts E and S calculation\r\n- post-burst-search selection based on multiple criteria (for ex.:\r\nburst size, burst width, E, S, ...). Defining a new burst selection\r\ncriterium requires only a couple of lines of code.\r\n- fit routines for FRET efficiency (1 and 2-gaussians histogram fit,\r\nMLE Poisson models, weighted least squares models,\r\nweighted expectation maximization, etc...)\r\n\r\nMoreover FRETBursts includes a large set of modular plot functions for\r\nbackground, time-traces, rate-traces, E, S, ALEX histograms, weighted kernel\r\ndensity estimation ([KDE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_density_estimation))\r\nand more. Thanks to the excellent [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) library,\r\nFRETBursts can produce publication-quality plots out of the box.\r\n\r\nMotivations\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nThis software aims to be a reference implementation for both established\r\nand novel algorithms related to bursts analysis of smFRET data.\r\n\r\nDespite the broad diffusion of smFRET experiments on freely diffusing\r\nmolecules, before FRETBursts, no complete smFRET burst analysis software is\r\nfreely available on internet. Each group have re-implemented the analysis\r\nin-house with little or no code sharing. This situation is clearly sub-optimal\r\neither because all the advances in the burst analysis are not readily\r\navailable to a wide public of smFRET users and because subtle differences in\r\nimplementation make the comparison of experiments performed by different\r\ngroups problematic.\r\n\r\nWe envision FRETBursts both as a state-of-the-art burst analysis package\r\nfor basic smFRET users, and as a benchmark for advanced users willing\r\nto explore new algorithms or to compare alternative implementations.\r\n\r\nSoftware Environment\r\n--------------------\r\nFRETBursts is written in the [python programming language](http://www.python.org/)\r\nusing the standard scientific-python stack of libraries (Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib, IPython).\r\n\r\nFRETBursts uses consolidated software engineering techniques (version control,\r\nunit testing, regression testing) and a workflow based on\r\n[IPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)\r\nto ensure robustness and reproducibility of the results. For example,\r\nwhen loading FRETBursts in an ipython notebook, the current commit ID is always\r\ndisplayed and saved.\r\n\r\nWe provide a [list of tutorials](#how-to-use) (IPython notebooks) that can be\r\nviewed online, edited and re-executed. The\r\n[reference documentation](http://fretbursts.readthedocs.org/)\r\nis generated by Sphinx extracting the docstring from the source.\r\n\r\n###External resources\r\n\r\nFor a comprehensive tutorial on using python for scientific computing:\r\n\r\n* [Python Scientific Lecture Notes](http://scipy-lectures.github.io/)\r\n\r\nIPython Notebook is an interactive web-based environment that allows mixing\r\nrich text, math and graphics with (live) code. For more info please visit:\r\n\r\n* [The IPython Notebook Homepage](http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/stable/interactive/notebook.html)\r\n* [Notebook examples](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/ipython/ipython/blob/master/examples/Notebook/Index.ipynb)\r\n* [A gallery of interesting IPython Notebooks](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/A-gallery-of-interesting-IPython-Notebooks)\r\n\r\n##Installation\r\n\r\nBriefly, the installation consist in installing a scientific python distribution,\r\ndownloading FRETBursts sources, and setting a folder for the FRETBursts notebooks.\r\n\r\nFRETBursts is loaded running a small script (`load_fretbursts.py`) placed\r\nin the notebooks folder. The first time, you need to edit `load_fretbursts.py`\r\nto specify where the FRETBursts source directory is on your system.\r\n\r\nIn the following sections you can find more detailed installation instructions\r\nfor the different platforms.\r\n\r\n###Windows\r\n\r\nIn order to run the code you need to install a scientific python\r\ndistribution like [Anaconda](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/).\r\nThe free version of Anaconda includes all the needed dependencies.\r\nAny other scientific python distribution (for example\r\n[Enthought Canopy](https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/))\r\nwill work as well.\r\n\r\nOnce a python distribution is installed, download the latest version\r\nof [FRETBursts](https://github.com/tritemio/FRETBursts) from *GitHub*.\r\nIf new to git, we recommend to use the graphical application\r\n[SourceTree](http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) (selecting the option of\r\nusing the embedded git).\r\n\r\nThe most user friendly way to use FRETBursts is through an IPython Notebook.\r\nThe following paragraph shows how to configure it.\r\n\r\n####Configuring IPython Notebook\r\n\r\nWhen starting the IPython server, it will show a default folder for the notebooks.\r\nYou can create a launcher to start the IPython Notebook server on any local folder.\r\n\r\nTo create the launcher, right click on the\r\n*IPython Notebook icon* -> *Properties* and paste\r\nthe notebook folder in the *Start in* field.\r\n\r\nNow, on double click, a browser should pop up showing the list\r\nof notebooks. Chrome browser is suggested.\r\n\r\n###Linux and Mac OS X\r\n\r\nOn Linux or Mac OS X you can also use the [Anaconda](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/) distribution.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, these are the software dependencies (hint: on Mac OS X you can use MacPorts):\r\n\r\n- Python 2.7\r\n- Numpy/Scipy (any version from 2013 on)\r\n- Matplotlib with qt (pyside) backend (1.3.x or greater)\r\n- IPython 1.x (2.x suggested)\r\n- PyTables 3.x (optional)\r\n- a modern browser (Chrome suggested)\r\n\r\n\r\n##How to use\r\n\r\nWe provide a list of IPython notebooks showing typical workflows\r\nfor smFRET analysis and illustrating FRETBursts functionalities.\r\nThese notebooks can be executed locally using publically available datasets\r\n(see below).\r\n\r\n* [FRETBursts - usALEX Workflow](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/tritemio/FRETBursts_notebooks/master/notebooks/FRETBursts%2520-%2520usALEX%2520Workflow.ipynb)\r\n* [FRETBursts - 8-spot smFRET analysis](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/tritemio/FRETBursts_notebooks/master/notebooks/FRETBursts%2520-%25208-spot%2520smFRET%2520analysis.ipynb)\r\n\r\nThe FRETBursts documentation is hosted on ReadTheDocs:\r\n\r\n* [FRETBursts Documentation](http://fretbursts.readthedocs.org/)\r\n\r\nWe provide a public dataset [1] to testing and demonstration of the FRETBursts\r\nfunctionalities.
