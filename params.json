It provides\r\na well-tested implementation of state-of-the-art algorithms\r\nfor confocal smFRET analysis.\r\nThe strong focus on computational reproducibility is\r\nreflected in the notebook-based interface.\r\nBy leveraging a workflow based on [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html),\r\nFRETBursts facilitates saving all the analysis\r\nparameters, comments and results in a single re-runnable document.\r\n\r\nFRETBursts has full supports for [Photon-HDF5](http://photon-hdf5.org/) files:\r\nan open file format for single-molecule fluorescence experiments\r\n(see the [Biophys. J. paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/026484)).\r\n\r\n### Feedback and Contributions\r\n\r\nFRETBursts is open source and openly developed on GitHub.\r\n\r\nWe encourage users to report issues or ask questions using the\r\n[GitHub Issue](https://github.com/tritemio/FRETBursts/issues?state=open).\r\nIn the open source spirit, contributions are welcome and \r\nmanaged using [GitHub Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request).\r\nAny level of contribution is accepted, from fixing typos, improving the docs\r\n(most editing can be done online directly)\r\nor implementing new features (see [github help page](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)). \r\nFor questions on how to contribute\r\nplease open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/tritemio/FRETBursts/issues?state=open).\r\n\r\n### Techinical features\r\n\r\nFRETBursts allows to analyze both [single-spot](http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.283.5408.1676)\r\nand [multi-spot smFRET](http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2003704) data.\r\nAlternating laser excitation ([ALEX](http://dx.doi.org/10.1529/biophysj.104.054114))\r\nscheme is supported.\r\n\r\nMain analysis features includes:\r\n\r\n- background estimation as a function of time (for example in 30s windows)\r\n- sliding-window burst search with adaptive (background-dependent) rate-threshold.\r\n  No timetrace binning required. Both single (APBS) and dual-channel burst search (DCBS).\r\n- burst corrections: background, D-spectral leakage (bleed-through),\r\n  A-direct excitation, gamma-factor.\r\n- per-burst statistics (# photons, burst duration, E, S, peak rate in burst, etc...)\r\n- post-burst-search [selection functions](http://fretbursts.readthedocs.org/en/latest/burst_selection.html)\r\n  (for ex.: [burst size](http://fretbursts.readthedocs.org/en/latest/burst_selection.html#fretbursts.select_bursts.size),\r\n  [burst width](http://fretbursts.readthedocs.org/en/latest/burst_selection.html#fretbursts.select_bursts.width),\r\n  [E, S](http://fretbursts.readthedocs.org/en/latest/burst_selection.html#fretbursts.select_bursts.ES), ...).\r\n  Defining a new burst selection criterium requires only a few lines of code.\r\n- [fit routines](http://fretbursts.readthedocs.org/en/latest/fit.html) for FRET efficiency\r\n  ([multi-model histogram fit](http://fretbursts.readthedocs.org/en/latest/fit.html#fitting-e-or-s-histograms),\r\n  [MLE Poisson models](http://fretbursts.readthedocs.org/en/latest/data_class.html#fretbursts.burstlib.Data.fit_E_ML_poiss),\r\n  [weighted least squares models](http://fretbursts.readthedocs.org/en/latest/data_class.html#fretbursts.burstlib.Data.fit_E_m),\r\n  [weighted expectation maximization](http://fretbursts.readthedocs.org/en/latest/data_class.html#fretbursts.burstlib.Data.fit_E_two_gauss_EM),\r\n  etc...)\r\n- Plot function: FRETBursts includes\r\n  [a large set](https://github.com/tritemio/FRETBursts/blob/master/fretbursts/burst_plot.py)\r\n  of modular\r\n  [plot functions](http://fretbursts.readthedocs.org/en/latest/files_description.html#module-fretbursts.burst_plot)\r\n  for background, time-traces, rate-traces, E, S, ALEX histograms,\r\n  weighted kernel density estimation ([KDE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_density_estimation))\r\n  and more. Thanks to the excellent [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) library,\r\n  FRETBursts can produce publication-quality plots out of the box.\r\n\r\nAdditionally FRETBursts includes notebooks to perform\r\n[Burst Variance Analysis (BVA)](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/tritemio/FRETBursts_notebooks/blob/master/notebooks/Example%20-%20Burst%20Variance%20Analysis.ipynb)\r\n[(Torella 2011)](http://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2011.01.066)\r\nand [2CDE](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/tritemio/FRETBursts_notebooks/blob/master/notebooks/Example%20-%202CDE%20Method.ipynb)\r\n[(Tomov 2012)](http://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2011.11.4025).\r\n\r\nMotivations\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nThis software aims to be a reference implementation for both established\r\nand novel algorithms related to bursts analysis of smFRET data.\r\n\r\nDespite the broad diffusion of smFRET experiments on freely diffusing\r\nmolecules, before FRETBursts, no complete smFRET burst analysis software was\r\nfreely available on internet. Each group have re-implemented the analysis\r\nin-house with little or no code sharing. This is clearly sub-optimal\r\neither because specific advances in the burst analysis are not readily\r\navailable to a wide public of smFRET users and because subtle differences in\r\nimplementation make the comparison of experiments performed by different\r\ngroups problematic.\r\n\r\nWe envision FRETBursts both as a state-of-the-art burst analysis package\r\nfor smFRET experimenters, and as a toolkit for advanced users willing\r\nto develop new algorithms or to compare alternative implementations.\r\n\r\nSoftware Environment\r\n--------------------\r\nFRETBursts is written in the [python programming language](http://www.python.org/)\r\nusing the standard scientific-python stack of libraries (Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib, IPython).\r\nNot only FRETBursts but also the entire software stack on which it is built upon\r\nare open-source and freely available to any scientist.\r\n\r\nFRETBursts uses consolidated software engineering techniques (version control,\r\nunit testing, regression testing) and a workflow based on\r\n[Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)\r\nto ensure robustness and reproducibility of the results. For example,\r\nwhen loading FRETBursts, the current version (down to the commit ID) is always\r\ndisplayed (and saved together with the notebook).\r\n\r\nWe provide a [list of tutorials](#getting-started) (notebooks) that\r\ncan be viewed online, edited and re-executed. The\r\n[reference documentation](http://fretbursts.readthedocs.org/)\r\nis generated by Sphinx extracting the docstrings from the source code.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nBriefly, the installation requires installing a scientific python distribution\r\n(such as [Continuum Anaconda](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/))\r\nand then installing the `fretbursts` python package from the anaconda.org\r\nchannel called `tritemio`.\r\n\r\nFor installation instructions see:\r\n\r\n* [FRETBursts documentation: Getting started](http://fretbursts.readthedocs.org/en/latest/getting_started.html)\r\n\r\n## Getting started\r\n\r\nThe official FRETBursts documentation is built and hosted by ReadTheDocs:\r\n\r\n* [FRETBursts Documentation](http://fretbursts.readthedocs.org/)\r\n\r\nWe provide a list of Jupyter notebooks showing typical workflows\r\nfor smFRET analysis and illustrating FRETBursts functionalities.\r\nThese notebooks can be either viewed online or downloaded and executed locally\r\nusing publically available datasets (see below).
