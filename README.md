Project description
-------------------

**[FRETBursts](https://github.com/tritemio/FRETBursts)** is an opensource
software toolkit for analysis of timestamps series from confocal
[single-molecule FRET](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-molecule_FRET)
(smFRET) experiments on freely diffusing molecules.

In the spirit of reproducible research, this software allows the authors and
others to reproduce previous research and to perform new one. FRETBursts
is open to public scrutiny and the authors are committed to promptly fix bugs
whenever they are discovered.

Issues can be reported or discussed on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/tritemio/FRETBursts/issues?state=open). 
Fixes or enhacements can be sent with a [github pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request). 
Typo fixes or small corrections can be made directly online 
by clicking on the GiHub edit button for a specific file.

FRETBursts allows to analyze both [single-spot](http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.283.5408.1676)
and [multi-spot smFRET](http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2003704) data.
Alternating laser excitation ([ALEX](http://dx.doi.org/10.1529/biophysj.104.054114))
scheme is supported as well.

Main analysis features includes:

- background estimation as a function of time (for example in 30s windows)
- sliding-window burst search with adaptive (background-dependent) threshold
- burst corrections: background, leakage (bleed-through), direct excitation,
gamma-factor
- per-burst quatities (# photons, burst duration, E, S, etc...)
- post-burst-search selection based on multiple criteria (for ex.:
burst size, burst width, E, S, ...). Defining a new burst selection
criterium requires only a couple of lines of code.
- fit routines for FRET efficiency (1 and 2-gaussians histogram fit,
MLE Poisson models, weighted least squares models,
weighted expectation maximization, etc...)

Moreover FRETBursts includes a large set of modular plot functions for
background, time-traces, rate-traces, E, S, ALEX histograms, weighted kernel
density estimation ([KDE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_density_estimation))
and more. Thanks to the excellent [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) library,
FRETBursts can produce publication-quality plots out of the box.

Motivations
-----------

This software aims to be a reference implementation for both established
and novel algorithms related to bursts analysis of smFRET data.

Despite the broad diffusion of smFRET experiments on freely diffusing
molecules, before FRETBursts, no complete smFRET burst analysis software is
freely available on internet. Each group have re-implemented the analysis
in-house with little or no code sharing. This situation is clearly sub-optimal
either because all the advances in the burst analysis are not readily
available to a wide public of smFRET users and because subtle differences in
implementation make the comparison of experiments performed by different
groups problematic.

We envision FRETBursts both as a state-of-the-art burst analysis package
for basic smFRET users, and as a benchmark for advanced users willing
to explore new algorithms or to compare alternative implementations.

Software Environment
--------------------
FRETBursts is written in the [python programming language](http://www.python.org/)
using the standard scientific-python stack of libraries (Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib, IPython).

FRETBursts uses consolidated software engineering techniques (version control,
unit testing, regression testing) and a workflow based on
[IPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)
to ensure robustness and reproducibility of the results. For example,
when loading FRETBursts in an ipython notebook, the current commit ID is always
displayed and saved.

We provide a [list of tutorials](#how-to-use) (IPython notebooks) that can be
viewed online, edited and re-executed. The
[reference documentation](http://fretbursts.readthedocs.org/)
is generated by Sphinx extracting the docstring from the source.

###External resources

For a comprehensive tutorial on using python for scientific computing:

* [Python Scientific Lecture Notes](http://scipy-lectures.github.io/)

IPython Notebook is an interactive web-based environment that allows mixing
rich text, math and graphics with (live) code. For more info please visit:

* [The IPython Notebook Homepage](http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/stable/interactive/notebook.html)
* [Notebook examples](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/ipython/ipython/blob/master/examples/Notebook/Index.ipynb)
* [A gallery of interesting IPython Notebooks](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/A-gallery-of-interesting-IPython-Notebooks)

##Installation

Briefly, the installation consist in installing a scientific python
distribution, downloading FRETBursts sources, and setting a folder for the
FRETBursts notebooks.

FRETBursts is loaded running a small script (`load_fretbursts.py`) placed
in the notebooks folder. The first time, you need to edit `load_fretbursts.py`
to specify where the FRETBursts source directory is on your system.

In the following sections you can find more detailed installation instructions
for the different platforms.

###Windows

In order to run the code you need to install a scientific python
distribution like [Anaconda](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/).
The free version of Anaconda includes all the needed dependencies.
Any other scientific python distribution (for example
[Enthought Canopy](https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/))
will work as well.

Once a python distribution is installed, download the latest version
of [FRETBursts](https://github.com/tritemio/FRETBursts) from *GitHub*.
If new to git, we recommend to use the graphical application
[SourceTree](http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/), selecting the option of
using the embedded git. FRETBursts will look for git in the system path
or in the SourceTree embedded path and will use it to display the
current revision ID in the notebook.

The most convenient way to use FRETBursts is through an IPython Notebook.
The following paragraph shows how to configure it.

####Configuring IPython Notebook

When starting the IPython server, it will show a default folder for the
notebooks. You can create a launcher to start the IPython Notebook server
on any local folder.

To create a new launcher, copy the IPython Notebook icon from the windows
menu to some convenient location (i.e. the Desktop or your notebook folder).
Then, right click on the *IPython Notebook icon* -> *Properties* and paste
the notebook folder in the *Start in* field.

Now, on double click, a browser showing the list of notebooks should open.
Chrome browser is suggested.

###Linux and Mac OS X

On Linux or Mac OS X you can also use the [Anaconda](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/) distribution.

Alternatively, these are the software dependencies (hint: on Mac OS X you can
use MacPorts):

- Python 2.7
- Numpy/Scipy (any version from 2013 on)
- Matplotlib with qt (pyside) backend (1.3.x or greater)
- IPython 1.x (2.x suggested)
- PyTables 3.x (optional)
- a modern browser (Chrome suggested)


##How to use

We provide a list of IPython notebooks showing typical workflows
for smFRET analysis and illustrating FRETBursts functionalities.
These notebooks can be executed locally using publically available datasets
(see below).

The FRETBursts documentation is hosted on ReadTheDocs:

* [FRETBursts Documentation](http://fretbursts.readthedocs.org/)

We provide a public dataset [1] to test and demonstrate FRETBursts
functionalities. These data files are needed to re-run the tutorials.

##Development

The documentation is built using [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/) (1.2.2 or
later) and the [napoleon extension](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/sphinxcontrib-napoleon).
A notebook that builds the HTML docs can be found in `notebooks/dev/docs/`.

The unit tests are written with [pytest](http://pytest.org/latest/).
Notebooks that execute the unit tests can be found in `notebooks/dev/test/`.
In the same folder a notebook for regression testing is provided.
