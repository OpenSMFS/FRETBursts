Burst Search Program 
====================

Basic requirements
------------------

python 2.6 (or greater)
numpy 1.4 (or greater)
SciPy 0.8 (or greater)
matplotlib 1.0 (or greater)
ipython
pyQT4 (only for the interactive timetraces and ALEX GUI)


Windows Installation Notes
--------------------------

Install PythonXY (scientific python distribution) with standard settings.

- Edit path_def.py to point to the correct data folder
- Copy path_def.py from burst folder into qt4 folder.


Ubuntu Installation Notes
-------------------------

Install python-scipy python-matplotlib and optionally python-libqt4.


Installing Matplotlib from sources on Linux (not need anymore)
--------------------------------------------------------------

Matplotlib 0.99 provided until ubuntu 11.04 lacks the "subplots" command that ease a bit creaation of multiple plots.

To install the last matplotlib from sources download the tar.gz, uncompress and compile it with

$ python setup.py build

in the beginning of the process you see which libs are found in the system. I usually stop the building with CTRL+s (freeze the terminal) and check that at least libpng and pygtk are found (btw to resume/unfreeze press CTRL-q). If not, install the corresponding -dev packages and relaunch the build.

Then I install the files in a local folder (to don't interfere with matplotlib version provided by the distribution) with:

$ python setup.py install --home=/home/anto/src/python

and finally I add this line to ~/.bashrc:

export PYTHONPATH="$HOME/src/python/lib/python/"

to tell python to search for libs in this local folder before looking in system wide folders.

To be sure it works open a python shell and type:

$ python
Python 2.7.1+ (r271:86832, Apr 11 2011, 18:13:53)
[GCC 4.5.2] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import matplotlib
>>> matplotlib.__version__
'1.0.1'
>>>

you see the new version here (1.0.x, not 0.9x).
